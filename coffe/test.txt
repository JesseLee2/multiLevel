##### Process Technology Parameters

# Transistor type can be 'bulk' or 'finfet'. 
# Make sure your spice model file matches the transistor type you choose.
transistor_type=bulk

# The switch type can be 'pass_transistor' or 'transmission_gate'.
switch_type=pass_transistor

# Supply voltage
vdd=0.8

# SRAM Vdd
vsram=1.0

# SRAM Vss
vsram_n=0.0

# Gate length (nm)
gate_length=22

# This parameter controls the gate length of PMOS level-restorers. For example, setting this paramater 
# to 4 sets the gate length to 4x the value of 'gate_legnth'. Increasing the gate length weakens the 
# PMOS level-restorer, which is sometimes necessary to ensure proper switching.
rest_length_factor = 1

# Minimum transistor diffusion width (nm).
min_tran_width=45

# Length of diffusion for a single-finger transistor (nm).
# COFFE uses this when it calculates source/drain parasitic capacitances.
trans_diffusion_length = 52

# Minimum-width transistor area (nm^2)
min_width_tran_area = 28851

# SRAM area (in number of minimum width transistor areas)
sram_cell_area = 4

##### Metal data
##### R in ohms/nm
##### C in fF/nm
##### format: metal=R,C
##### ex: metal=0.054825,0.000175
#######################################

# Each 'metal' statement defines a new metal layer. 
# COFFE uses two metal layers by default. The first metal layer is where COFFE 
# implements all wires except for the general routing wires. They are implemented
# in the second metal layer. 

# All wires except the general routing wires are implemented in this layer.
metal=0.054825,0.000175

# General routing wires will be implemented in this layer 
metal=0.007862,0.000215

# If you wanted to, you could define more metal layers by adding more 'metal'
# statements but, by default, COFFE would not use them because it only uses 2 layers.
# The functionality of being able to add any number of metal layers is here to allow
# you to investigate the use of more than 2 metal layers if you wanted to. However,
# making use of more metal layers would require changes to the COFFE source code.
